= How to contribute

In general, contributions are very much appreciated. Just open a PR with your changes.

However, please follow the following guidelines:

* Keep the Pull Request small: Open one PR per feature or bug fix. +
This is to make reviews easier and keep the potential for bugs down. 
It is completely fine to have multiple open pull requests.

* A pull request should always go to the `experimental` branch first. 
This branch will be merged to the `master` branch once it is deemed there was enough testing.
